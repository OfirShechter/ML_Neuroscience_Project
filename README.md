# ML_Neuroscience_Project

In this project we identify patterns in brain waves of a lizard using **signal processing** tools, **clustering**, **autocorrelation**, and **time series prediction network**. In addition we **classify** sleep or wakefulness state of the lizard according to the wave record using a **deep learning network** (Multilayer Perceptron).
